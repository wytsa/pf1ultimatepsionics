They gain +2 Constitution and +2 Wisdom but suffer &ndash;2 Dexterity.</li>\n<li><strong>Size:</strong> Norals are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li>\n<li><strong>Type:</strong> Norals are of the humanoid type with the noral subtype.</li>\n<li><strong>Languages:</strong> Norals begin play speaking Common and Noral. Norals with high Intelligence scores can choose can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic). See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Other Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Symbiotic Resistance:</strong> The symbiotic bond between the noral and the erliss grants all bonded norals a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against disease and mind-affecting effects.</li>\n<li><strong>Symbiotic Surge:</strong> A noral is able to tap into the power of the symbiote to gain a temporary boost. Once per day, a noral can exhauste the symbiote to add 1d6 to a single d20 roll. This decision must be made prior to the result of the roll is determined.</li>\n<li><strong>Noral Psionics:</strong> Norals gain the following psi-like ability: 1/day&mdash;mind thrust. The manifester level for this effect is equal to 1/2 the noral&rsquo;s level (minimum 1st). The DC for this power is equal to 10 + the power&rsquo;s level + the noral&rsquo;s Charisma modifier.</li>\n<li><strong>Gift of Tongues:</strong> Norals are naturally skilled at social interactions and understanding other cultures. Norals gain a +1 racial bonus on Bluff and Diplomacy checks, and they learn one additional language every time they put a rank in the Linguistics skill.</li>\n<li><strong>Vision:</strong> Norals have low-light vision (they can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.) See <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/vision-and-light\">Vision and Light</a> for details.</li>\n<li><strong>Naturally Psionic:</strong> Norals gain the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/wild-talent\">Wild Talent</a> feat as a bonus feat at 1st level. If a noral takes levels in a psionic class, he instead gains the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/psionic-talent-psionic\">Psionic Talent</a> feat.</li>\n<li><strong>Psionic Aptitude:</strong> When a noral takes a level in a favored class, he can choose to gain an additional power point instead of a hit point or skill point.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Empathic Persuasion:</strong> Some norals are skilled at subtle psychic manipulation, despite their fellow norals&rsquo; dislike of such. Once per day, the noral may manifest empathic connection as a psi-like ability (manifester level equal to 1/2 the noral&rsquo;s Hit Dice, minimum 1). This replaces noral psionics.</li>\n<li><strong>Feral Erliss:</strong> While a noral bonding with an erliss typically results in improved mental abilities, sometimes it results in the noral taking on more feral aspects. A noral with this trait gains two claw attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage and gains a +2 racial bonus on Survival checks. This replaces gift of tongues and symbiotic resistance.</li>\n<li><strong>Master of Deception:</strong> All norals are skilled at interacting with other races, but some are unusually skilled in subterfuge. A noral with this trait gains a +4 racial bonus on Bluff checks to convince an opponent that what they are saying is true when they tell a lie. In addition, once per day, the noral can roll twice when making a Bluff or Diplomacy check and take the better roll. This replaces noral psionics.</li>\n<li><strong>Resilient Symbiote:</strong> The bonding process with an erliss can sometimes unlock a psionic ability to protect instead of attack. A noral with this trait gains the ability to use vigor as a psi-like ability once per day (manifester level equal to noral&rsquo;s character level.) This replaces noral psionics.</li>\n<li><strong>Symbiote Sensitivity:</strong> Some norals have an erliss that can grant the ability to detect nearby psionic activity. A noral with this trait gains detect psionics as a psi-like ability usable at will (manifester level is equal to the noral&rsquo;s character level). This replaces noral psionics.</li>\n<li><strong>Symbiotic Sentry:</strong> Some erliss take a more passive role in protecting the noral, warning their host when subject to psychic attack. When the noral fails a Save against a mind-affecting effect, he may immediately roll a second Save; if the second Save is successful, he is still affected by the effect, but he is at least aware of a psychic attack and his failure to block it, even if he does not know the exact attack or its consequences (thus, he may take defensive precautions, such as manifesting dispel psionics on himself or casting protection from evil, if possible). Once per day, if the second Save is successful the noral may choose to use that result in place of the first roll. This replaces symbiotic resistance and symbiotic surge.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Racial Variants</h2>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span id=\"Champion_Forgeborn_Racial_Variant\">Interfacer</span></span></h3>\n<p>Interfacers imbue themselves with technological components to augment their combat and perceptive abilities. However, the cybertech imbued within an interfacer is more a partner than a tool, an artificial companion with its own impressions that supports its host using its directive abilities.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ability Score Modifiers: </strong>Interfacers are conscientious and scholarly, but they are not always the most present or socially aware due to constant communication with their interface. They gain +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, but suffer -2 Charisma. This racial trait replaces the noral&rsquo;s usual ability modifiers.</li>\n<li><strong>Akashic Entity: </strong>Interfacers lose the psionic subtype, but gain the akashic subtype.</li>\n<li><strong>Bonus Essence: </strong>Interfacers gain an akashic connection as a result of their symbiote, and start play with 1 bonus essence point. This ability replaces naturally psionic and psionic aptitude.</li>\n<li><strong>Akashic Surge: </strong>The interfacer may invest essence in his symbiotic surge ability, gaining an additional use per day for each point of essence invested and increasing the bonus for each point of essence invested. This ability replaces noral psionics and modifies symbiotic resistance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bard: </strong>Add 1 to the total number of bardic performance rounds per day.</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptic: </strong>Add +1/2 to the damage of disrupt pattern.</li>\n<li><strong>Dread : </strong>Add +1/2 to daily use of terrors.</li>\n<li><strong>Druid: </strong>Add +1/2 to Handle Animal and wild empathy checks.</li>\n<li><strong>Paladin: </strong>Add +2.5&rsquo; to the range of detect evil when focusing on a single target.</li>\n<li><strong>Psion: </strong>Add +1/2 to concentration checks when manifesting psion powers.</li>\n<li><strong>Ranger: </strong>Add +1/2 to Bluff, Perception, and Sense Motive checks against one of his favored enemy types.</li>\n<li><strong>Rogue: </strong>Add +1/3 to Bluff and Sense Motive checks.</li>\n<li><strong>Soulknife: </strong>Add +1/2 to psychic strike damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Tactician: </strong>Add +1/2 to the maximum number of creatures allowed in the collective.</li>\n<li><strong>Vitalist: </strong>Add +1/2 to the maximum number of creatures allowed in the collective.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[{"id":"cdaGWzVBEvEL4Zgv","dataType":"data","name":"Ability Score Modifiers (Noral)","img":"Race_Noral.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":0},{"id":"alrwwTYZSJ0seLVQ","dataType":"data","name":"Base Speed (Noral)","img":"Race_Noral.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":1},{"id":"fXcf5e5GdIMjkUc1","dataType":"data","name":"Gift of Tongues (Noral)","img":"Race_Noral.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":2},{"id":"2YydakcOiQPPRT44","dataType":"data","name":"Languages (Noral)","img":"Race_Noral.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":3},{"id":"vT58sQP5R1YSx3mD","dataType":"data","name":"Naturally Psionic (Noral)","img":"Race_Noral.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":4},{"id":"XcEsSE5rz23qF1hB","dataType":"data","name":"Noral Psionics (Noral)","img":"Race_Noral.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":5},{"id":"JhSieXNXDiMU8Rxu","dataType":"data","name":"Psionic Aptitude (Noral)","img":"Race_Noral.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":6},{"id":"KDQkvixinkv4MIlT","dataType":"data","name":"Race Power Points (Noral)","img":"Race_Noral.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":7},{"id":"A7998Gi8TdMA6Csl","dataType":"data","name":"Size (Noral)","img":"Race_Noral.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":8},{"id":"aoYFG7hx2Sro8fud","dataType":"data","name":"Symbiotic Resistance (Noral)","img":"Race_Noral.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":9},{"id":"Svbp7I7hOt0vicLO","dataType":"data","name":"Symbiotic Surge (Noral)","img":"Race_Noral.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":10},{"id":"zNIN0E1zS9jti58M","dataType":"data","name":"Type (Noral)","img":"Race_Noral.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":11},{"id":"rHKSj1vWd3jpiXhc","dataType":"data","name":"Vision (Noral)","img":"Race_Noral.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":12}]},"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"creatureType":"humanoid","subTypes":[],"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"heroes-for-hire","system":"pf1","coreVersion":"0.7.9","systemVersion":"0.76.13"}},"img":"Race_Noral.webp","effects":[],"_id":"2W7AjuoPC5KzMwKf"}

If a half-giant takes levels in a psionic class, he instead gains the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/psionic-talent-psionic\">Psionic Talent</a> feat.</li>\n<li><strong>Half-Giant Psionics:</strong> Half-giants gain the following psi-like ability: 1/day&mdash;stomp. The manifester level for this effect is equal to 1/2 the half-giant&rsquo;s level (minimum 1st). The DC for this power is equal to 10 + the power&rsquo;s level + the half-giant&rsquo;s Charisma modifier.</li>\n<li><strong>Psionic Aptitude:</strong> When a half-giant takes a level in a favored class, he can choose to gain an additional power point instead of a hit point or skill point.</li>\n<li><strong>Survivor:</strong> Half-giants gain a +4 racial bonus to Survival checks.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cold Acclimated:</strong> Although most half-giants reside in desert regions, some have grown toughened against colder extremes. Half-giants with this trait receive a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against all cold spells, powers and effects. This replaces the fire acclimated trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Flame of Freedom:</strong> Half-giants have an affinity for heat and fire. Half-giants with this trait gain a +1 racial bonus to their manifester level on powers with the [fire] descriptor. This trait replaces the half-giant psionics trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Juggernaut:</strong> Physically imposing, some half-giants are especially gifted at manhandling opponents in combat. Half-giants with this trait gain a +1 racial bonus to their CMB on bull rush, overrun, and trip attempts. This trait replaces the half-giant psionics and survivor traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Liberty or Death:</strong> The history of the half-giants speaks of them once being an enslaved race. Some half-giants have a built-in defense against being subjugated against their will. Half-giants with this bonus gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects. This trait replaces the fire acclimated trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Psionic Resonance:</strong> Although considered by the uninformed to be violent and primitive as a race, many half-giants have a natural affinity to handling psionic items. Half-giants with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus to Use Magic Device checks to activate an item or to use a power stone. This trait replaces the survivor trait.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aegis:</strong> Add +1 to the aegis&rsquo;s CMD when resisting a bull rush or grapple.</li>\n<li><strong>Barbarian:</strong> Add 1 to the half giant&rsquo;s total number of rage rounds per day.</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptic:</strong> Add +1 to the cryptic&rsquo;s CMD when resisting a grapple or trip.</li>\n<li><strong>Paladin:</strong> Add +1/2 to the paladin&rsquo;s smite evil damage rolls.</li>\n<li><strong>Psychic Warrior:</strong> Add +1/2 to the psychic warrior&rsquo;s manifester level when manifesting a path power.</li>\n<li><strong>Sorcerer:</strong> Add +1/2 to fire spell damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Soulknife:</strong> Add +1/2 to the soulknife&rsquo;s CMB when attempting a sunder or overrun.</li>\n<li><strong>Vitalist:</strong> Add +1/2 to the half-giant&rsquo;s Heal checks.</li>\n<li><strong>Wilder:</strong> The wilder gains 1 psionic talent.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[{"id":"gYqfR7rh0uHteCXf","dataType":"data","name":"Ability Score Modifiers (Half-Giant)","img":"Race_Half-Giant.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":0},{"id":"fZPbXqFismsTtBnv","dataType":"data","name":"Base Speed (Half-Giant)","img":"Race_Half-Giant.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":1},{"id":"ExpdygIaBC93rT2j","dataType":"data","name":"Fire Acclimated (Half-Giant)","img":"Race_Half-Giant.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":2},{"id":"rwapqVGfqW11jezt","dataType":"data","name":"Half-Giant Psionics (Half-Giant)","img":"Race_Half-Giant.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":3},{"id":"KbGlUdKTXMuvb0Lj","dataType":"data","name":"Languages (Half-Giant)","img":"Race_Half-Giant.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":4},{"id":"DJBNhVbQjR004dw6","dataType":"data","name":"Naturally Psionic (Half-Giant)","img":"Race_Half-Giant.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":5},{"id":"ZspU4rEDpKTw9gP6","dataType":"data","name":"Powerful Build (Half-Giant)","img":"Race_Half-Giant.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":6},{"id":"TASwTk9lsASu9rm2","dataType":"data","name":"Psionic Aptitude (Half-Giant)","img":"Race_Half-Giant.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":7},{"id":"bJIOhaDj9nAZrfut","dataType":"data","name":"Race Power Points (Half-Giant)","img":"Race_Half-Giant.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":8},{"id":"d66yzwOt1PrQz4ZS","dataType":"data","name":"Size (Half-Giant)","img":"Race_Half-Giant.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":9},{"id":"McnI1eZpRpS5moXS","dataType":"data","name":"Survivor (Half-Giant)","img":"Race_Half-Giant.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":10},{"id":"lij6nvOD6UaM9U49","dataType":"data","name":"Type (Half-Giant)","img":"Race_Half-Giant.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":11},{"id":"UZsG6VVuIRlMSAdH","dataType":"data","name":"Vision (Half-Giant)","img":"Race_Half-Giant.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":12}]},"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"creatureType":"humanoid","subTypes":[["human"],["humanoid (giant)"]],"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"heroes-for-hire","system":"pf1","coreVersion":"0.7.9","systemVersion":"0.76.13"}},"img":"Race_Half-Giant.webp","effects":[],"_id":"AiOa2KymBApbffhu"}
{"name":"Forgeborn","permission":{"default":0,"MsPD2JVY26a5XrG4":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Believed to have been created centuries ago during a great war between psionic nations, the race of creatures referred to as the forgeborn were left to their own devices within the barren wasteland the war left behind. A hybridization of flesh and minerals, the forgeborn are varied in appearance and form, but were all created by merging psionically-empowered materials with the body of a humanoid to fashion a new creature.</p>\n<p>The race seeks out humanoids to transform in order to increase their numbers and some say resume the conflict for which they were created. Although little is known about the creation process by non-forgeborn, rumors say that they take those critically wounded in combat and repair their bodies, wiping the new forgeborn&rsquo;s memories and giving new life to the otherwise-fallen. Some darker rumors say that the race has learned not only how to alter the living, but potentially the recently deceased, but there has been little proof of this.</p>\n<p>Although they may appear as some sort of bizarre construct, the forgeborn are intelligent and capable of thought, emotion, and reasoning. While much of their time is spent working out combat strategies and ways to harness the psionic energy that powers their forms, they are avid students of history.</p>\n<p>Forgeborn benefit from longer lifespans than the human bodies that most of them were made from, but their inclination for combat means many never actually reach middle age. Among the forgeborn, such a fate is not mourned, for the fallen can sometimes be reclaimed and rebuilt into a new member of the race, resulting in a theology very similar to reincarnation.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Forgeborn are a tall and thick race, and stand a few inches taller than most humans, with their bodies flowing from well-muscled flesh to mineral components and back. The exact nature of the forgeborn&rsquo;s mineral varies between members of the race, from crystal, to steel, to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Darkwood\">darkwood</a>, or even&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Mithral\">mithral</a>.</p>\n<p>All forgeborn have small glowing orbs embedded within their skull and chest, which are the psionic power source that animates their form. Although both male and female versions of forgeborn exist, such distinctions do not matter in forgeborn society, since there is no need for copulation. While most forgeborn come from human bodies, members from other races are not uncommon.</p>\n<p><strong>Society:</strong> The origins of the forgeborn have led them to have a social structure not unlike an army, where forgeborn tend to cluster based upon role, rather than from a family or tribal structure. While the race tends to prefer combat over negotiations, they are not vicious nor aggressive; they view combat as the best means to victory, rather than as a desired activity. All members of forgeborn society are given a role to benefit the civilization, and skill in that role is what measures a forgeborn&rsquo;s worth among his peers. There is an aesthetic element to some forgeborn, particularly in artwork depicting great battles, so forgeborn artisans are respected within their society.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong> Most races are uncomfortable with the unnatural form of the forgeborn, while the forgeborn view other races as inferior due to their reliance on sustenance and rest. Most members of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/elan/\">elan</a>&nbsp;race, however, view the forgeborn as abominations that are a disgusting perversion of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/elan/\">elan</a>&nbsp;transformation process.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong> Forgeborn view victory as the most important outcome and put no stock in honor. They fight to win, not to be honorable, although they do accept surrender. The structure of command is integral to the proper functioning of an army, so few forgeborn go against the defined chain of command. Most forgeborn are lawful neutral.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers:</strong> Those forgeborn who choose to visit new lands are often seeking to find new potential recruits for the ranks or want to study new combat tactics and the war histories of other nations. With little in the way of familial ties, few forgeborn get homesick, but feel an urge to return to share new information.</p>\n<p><strong>Names:</strong> Because forgeborn are built from members of other races, the names of forgeborn are varied and do not have common traditional names. Forgeborn names are drawn from any of the cultures around them.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Half-Constructs\">Half-Constructs</span></h3>\n<p>A half-construct is a group of creatures that are artificially enhanced or have parts replaced by constructed mechanisms, be they magical or mechanical.

This means that a half-construct can drink&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions\">potions</a>&nbsp;to benefit from their effects and can sleep in order to regain spells, but neither of these activities is required for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct\">construct</a>&nbsp;to survive or stay in good health.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Standard_Racial_Traits\"><a name=\"TOC-Standard-Racial-Traits\"></a>Standard Racial Traits</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Ability Score Modifiers: Forgeborn are strong and have quick minds, but are monstrous in appearance and have difficulty relating to other races.

Consult your GM before selecting these options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crystal Skin: Some forgeborn are made from shining crystal, which protects them against rays, but isn&rsquo;t as sturdy as other minerals. A forgeborn with this trait gains a +2 bonus to its AC against ray attacks. In addition, once per day it can deflect one ray as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions\">immediate action</a>. This replaces&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus\">natural armor</a>.</li>\n<li>Memory Matrix: There are some forgeborn who are created with an intuitive knack for knowledge or industry.

The forgeborn gains a +2 bonus to this skill and it is always a class skill. This ability replaces fearless.</li>\n<li>Oreheart: A forgeborn with this trait can be raised and resurrected, but can also be healed by repair effects such as reconstruction as if it were a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct\">construct</a>. The forgeborn heals only half as much from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing\">healing</a>&nbsp;effects (other than effects which work on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Construct\">constructs</a>, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-\">fast healing</a>&nbsp;and repair effects) and takes only half damage from negative energy effects. This ability replaces source crystal.</li>\n<li>Quickened Steps: Although most forgeborn are steady in their gait, some are designed for speed. Forgeborn with this trait have a speed of 30 ft. This replaces slow and steady and fearless.</li>\n<li>Second Skin: Not all forgeborn have a natrually tough exterior, but instead are extremely comfortable in armor. A forgeborn with this trait reduces any armor check penalty from armor worn by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and can sleep in medium or heavy metal armor without suffering ill effects from sleeping in armor. This replaces&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Natural-Armor-Bonus\">natural armor</a>.</li>\n<li>Strange Mind: The process of death and rebirth as a forgeborn can sometimes warp the mind of the new forgeborn.

They also get into the habit of eating regularly so as to avoid suspicion. By spending 1 power point as a swift action, a blue with this trait gains a +10 bonus on Disguise checks to appear as a normal goblin rather than a blue; this bonus lasts for 24 hours and is dismissable as a free action. This trait replaces the Repletion trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Kinslayer</strong>: Outcast blues must fight their own kind to survive. Blues with this trait gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against goblinoids. This replaces the repletion racial trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Leadership</strong>: Some blues naturally take on leadership roles, either directly controlling a tribe, or as an important advisor to a leader. A blue with this trait gains a +2 racial bonus to Diplomacy checks.

{"name":"Maenad","permission":{"default":0,"MsPD2JVY26a5XrG4":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>A primarily sea-faring race, maenads are a dichotomy. To outsiders, they appear to be extremely reserved, yet they are rumored to be exceptionally emotional. Both sides are actually true. As a race, maenads must maintain control over their internal emotional turmoil, except when they unleash these bottled-up emotions in powerful displays. Born with raging emotions that threaten to tear their psyche apart unless properly controlled, maenads do not know why they have these powerful emotions warring within them. Their legends speak of being wronged by an ancient deity that the maenads revolted against and overthrew, resulting in the emotional curse they maintain to date. Maenads have a proclivity to martial studies, as it gives an outlet for their bottled emotions.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description</strong>&nbsp;Standing slightly taller than humans, roughly shoulder to shoulder with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-orc\">half-orcs</a>, maenads are physically impressive. Male maenads are usually equal in height, but slightly heavier than females. They have thick, dark hair on their heads, but lack any other hair on their body; instead their skin is covered in flecks of sparkling crystals, giving them a peculiar sparkle. The coloration of these crystals define the look for each individual maenad, ranging from pale white to jet black, and many believe that the coloration is determined by their most powerful emotion. Maenads are naturally graceful and have fine features, possessing an elf-like beauty. They prefer heavier clothing, and wear armor if available, but tend to go barefoot, especially when aboard a ship.</p>\n<p><strong>Society</strong>&nbsp;As a primarily sea-faring race, maenads tend to live either in coastal regions, or on islands and archipelagos. The nature of the ocean tends to soothe the internal turmoil of the maenad mind, for the calm waters that can turn to a deadly tidal wave are something to which a maenad can relate. As a result, much of maenad society revolves around the ocean: fishing, sailing, and swimming are the main activities of a maenad society. Most maenad villages tend to be no larger than a few hundred residents. Many maenads turn to tradition and ritual as ways to control their emotions. In some villages, this ritualization can take over, where every aspect of life is defined by a ritual that must be followed, although this sort of extreme situation is uncommon among the race as a whole.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations</strong>&nbsp;Maenads are typically distant towards other races, although they are most comfortable with humans, who have various temperaments that are not very different from their own. The open emotions of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling\">halflings</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome\">gnomes</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/xeph/\">xephs</a>&nbsp;confuse maenads, who have a hard time understanding living in such a capricious and carefree fashion. Elven society flows at a good pace for most maenads, and the lightness of being soothes a maenad&rsquo;s spirit. While the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf\">dwarves</a>&nbsp;are often civilized, their brazen ways, physical tendencies, and love of drink tend to be off-putting for maenaeds, although they respect the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf\">dwarves</a>&lsquo; ability to hold a grudge. Maenads view the violent dispositions of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-orc\">half-orcs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/half-giant/\">half-giants</a>&nbsp;as a good excuse to channel their emotions in combat, but recognize that they should partake in such events sparingly.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment and Religion</strong>&nbsp;Maenads prefer to worship gods of dichotomy to represent the dual nature of the maenads&rsquo; emotion. Most maenads are lawful, seeing the structure of rules as helpful toward maintaining composure and self-control. Generally, they seek to help others also maintain their own self-control, and have a tendency toward good alignment as a result.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names</strong>&nbsp;Adrian, Idonas, Alyx, Kristobal, Dymien, Dannis, Mixamis, Philisophos.</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names</strong>&nbsp;Alyxia, Dayanara, Dimiris, Kaia, Kalli, Kyte, Mylissa, Panalope.</p>\n<div>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"><caption>Table: Random Starting Ages</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Adulthood</th>\n<th>Intuitive1</th>\n<th>Self-Taught2</th>\n<th>Trained3</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>40 years</td>\n<td>+1d6 years (41-46 years)</td>\n<td>+4d6 years (44-64 years)</td>\n<td>+6d6 years (46-76 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>1&nbsp;This category includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian\">barbarians</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle\">oracles</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue\">rogues</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerers</a>.<br />2&nbsp;This category includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard\">bards</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/cavalier\">cavaliers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighters</a>, gunslingers,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin\">paladins</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger\">rangers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner\">summoners</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch\">witches</a>.<br />3&nbsp;This category includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist\">alchemists</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">clerics</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druids</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor\">inquisitors</a>, magi,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monks</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizards</a>.</p>\n<div>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"><caption>Table: Random Height and Weight</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Gender</th>\n<th>Base Height</th>\n<th>Height Modifier</th>\n<th>Base Weight</th>\n<th>Weight Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Male</td>\n<td>5 ft. 4 in.</td>\n<td>+2d10 in.

This trait replaces the Stability trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Echoes of the Abyss</strong>: Some duergar are more deeply touched by their experiences underground than their fellows. A duergar with this trait is treated as an aberration rather than a humanoid whenever it would be beneficial (for example, harmful spells which target only humanoids such as Charm Person or Hold Person will automatically fail unless the duergar specifically chooses otherwise; rangers will not be able to use Favored Enemy against him unless they have both humanoids (dwarves) and aberrations as favored enemies, in which case the duergar suffers the lesser bonus of the two).

The insights and experience of their previous life allows a duergar with this trait to re-roll any d20 roll made once per day. This trait replaces the Hardy trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Waking Dreamer</strong>: You have adapted to always humming to keep That Which Sleeps Beneath from waking. You do not need to sleep at all and can meditate, fully awake and aware, for 4 hours to gain all the benefits of sleep, including regaining power points. This trait replaces the Duergar Psionics trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Whispers of Insanity</strong>: Some duergar hum insane lullabies mentally, rather than vocally, in a subconscious attempt to keep That Which Sleeps Beneath asleep, while they themselves suffer from insomnia. Duergar with this trait gain a +2 bonus on Perception and Stealth checks, and the DC to make Perception checks while sleeping is only +5 (rather than +10).

{"name":"Half-Giant","permission":{"default":0,"MsPD2JVY26a5XrG4":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Far back in their ancient history, half-giants were slaves to some form of king. Their stories vary from tribe to tribe, but their former status as slaves is one thread that is common in the lore of every half-giant tribe. As slaves, they fought their oppressors and earned their freedom. As a result, nothing is more important to half-giants than their liberty. They will fight and even kill to stay free, and few things are capable of breaking a half-giant&rsquo;s will to live like slavery. Indeed, most half-giants would prefer to commit suicide rather than face incarceration or enslavement. For these reasons, most half-giants tend to be law-abiding and respectful, but they can have a tendency to solve problems by resorting to violence rather than risk being apprehended. Some myths claim that they were spawned from fire giants, while others say that they worked in volcanic forges. Regardless of the truth, half-giants are more resilient to heat, a trait that serves them well in the present, as they have a tendency to dwell in arid lands and deserts.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description</strong>&nbsp;Standing over eight feet tall, half-giants are the largest of the common races, towering above even&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-orc\">half-orcs</a>, with males slightly taller and heavier than females. Their size makes them imposing but slow to react. Their skin ranges from nearly complete black to a deep tan, while their hair is almost always black. Their eyes typically range from blue to green, but a fair number have red eyes, making them stand out against other races. Most half-giants tend to wear little clothing, or very heavy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, depending on the situation; in a social gathering, their tribal clothing covers very little to account for their tendency to reside in hot lands, and most half-giants are proud of their bodies and physical looks and prowess. In combat, they prefer to wear heavy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, taking advantage of their natural strength and stature.</p>\n<p><strong>Society</strong>&nbsp;Half-giants most commonly organize themselves into nomadic and shifting tribes, following charismatic and wise leaders for brief periods. Many half-giants have a tendency to drift into and out of tribes over time, while a portion of a tribe may split out and start a new tribe, which may later merge with a larger tribe. When enemies gather, empires rise, or war looms, the half-giant tribes might unite under their strongest and wisest leaders, protecting each other from the threat of oppression. In times of peace, they splinter into hundreds of individual tribes, enjoying the freedom they hold so dear. As societies go, the half-giants are generally composed of nomadic hunters, taking down the giant sandworms of the desert or hunting elephants across the savannah and plains. Half-giants enjoy dancing, drinking and games of physical prowess such as wrestling, running, and spear throwing.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations&nbsp;</strong>Half-giants appreciate the open nature of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human\">humans</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-elf\">half-elves</a>&nbsp;and can sympathize with how&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-orc\">half-orcs</a>&nbsp;sometimes feel outside of society. Elves with their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow\">slow</a>&nbsp;pace,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf\">dwarves</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/maenad/\">maenads</a>&nbsp;with their rigid societies, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/ophiduan/\">ophiduans</a>&nbsp;with their expansionist behavior generally make the half-giants uncomfortable. Most of the other races are welcomed based on their behavior, although the carelessness of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling\">halflings</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/dromites/\">dromites</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome\">gnomes</a>&nbsp;worry the half-giants, who believe that it will lead to these smaller races being taken advantage of and, therefore, possible subservience and slavery. Half-giants keep&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/duergar\">duergars</a>&nbsp;at arm&rsquo;s length due to the use of slavery.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment and Religion</strong>&nbsp;Worshiping gods relating to freedom, nature, summer, and the hunt, half-giants are devout but very naturalistic. They manifest their worship with totem poles, believing the gods to be pleased with depictions of their power, thus protecting the tribe from evil. Most half-giants tend to be neutral or chaotic good, striving to help both the tribe and others as well as they can, although their belief in following the law to avoid incarceration can result in lawful half-giants. This does not mean that a half-giant won&rsquo;t resort to violence at the slightest sign of evil. Indeed, to most half-giants, jail, incarceration, and slavery are all seen as equally evil and to be fought to the last breath.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers&nbsp;</strong>Most half-giants are driven into adventuring by wanderlust and a wish to learn more about the world around them. Some are driven by religious conviction, while others understand that they will help their tribe the most by making the world a safer place. Very few adventure to make money, greed is a strange concept to most half-giants.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names</strong>&nbsp;Adoett, Abaque, Amayeta, Chumani, Donama, Maka, Macawi, Nashota, Odakota.</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names</strong>&nbsp;Hurit, Huyana, Awentia, Cholena, Kimella, Mika, Nadie, Dabun, Pahana.</p>\n<div>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"><caption>Table: Random Starting Ages</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Adulthood</th>\n<th>Intuitive1</th>\n<th>Self-Taught2</th>\n<th>Trained3</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>30 years</td>\n<td>+2d6 years (32-42 years)</td>\n<td>+3d6 years (33-48 years)</td>\n<td>+4d6 years (34-54 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>1&nbsp;This category includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian\">barbarians</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle\">oracles</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue\">rogues</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerers</a>.<br />2&nbsp;This category includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard\">bards</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/cavalier\">cavaliers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighters</a>, gunslingers,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin\">paladins</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger\">rangers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner\">summoners</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch\">witches</a>.<br />3&nbsp;This category includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist\">alchemists</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">clerics</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druids</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor\">inquisitors</a>, magi,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monks</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizards</a>.</p>\n<div>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"><caption>Table: Random Height and Weight</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Gender</th>\n<th>Base Height</th>\n<th>Height Modifier</th>\n<th>Base Weight</th>\n<th>Weight Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Male</td>\n<td>6 ft. 4 in.</td>\n<td>+2d12 in.

{"name":"Dromite","permission":{"default":0,"MsPD2JVY26a5XrG4":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Small and insectoid in appearance, dromites stand out in most crowds of humanoids. Their antennae, faceted eyes, carapace, and small stature make them visibly different from most. Hailing from a hivemind-like history, dromites have come to love and appreciate individuality while still continuing to live in a hive and collective environment. This individuality, together with a strong liberal view on life, means that while different, dromites rarely have a problem making friends or finding a place to live or work.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description</strong>&nbsp;Around the height of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome\">gnomes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling\">halflings</a>, dromites stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, but tend to be sturdier in nature. Dromites have a natural resistance towards the energy of their caste granted by the chitin that covers parts of their body. The caste of a dromite is easily recognized by the coloration of the carapace: red for Fire Caste, pale blue for Ice Caste, white for Voice Caste, and green for Glimmer Caste. The skin of the dromite not covered by chitin ranges from a pale white to a dark tan. Dromites have faceted eyes which often shine with a psionic energy, and large antennae that constantly quiver. Their small mouths are devoid of external mandibles, but when eating, small internal mandibles are used to help eat. Dromites have three fingers and a thumb, each covered in a pointed carapace, with the same for their four toes. This gives the dromites a look very different from other humanoids. Dromites are asexual, being neither female nor male, except in the case of the Hive Queen and Hive Consorts. In this situation, rituals are performed that grant gender and reproductive capabilities.</p>\n<p><strong>Society</strong>&nbsp;Most dromites organize themselves into hive cities &ndash; giant towers that are as much subterranean as they are exposed above ground. Here they embrace their caste as well as their individuality, striving to find their path in life. For some, this means striving to become a Hive Queen or Consort, the elected leaders of a hive, while for others it means learning a craft or toiling in a mine to make ends meet. While externally very idealistic, a society with very few laws and defining aspects also tends to become chaotic and disorganized. Most hive cities tend to walk the line between individual freedoms and communal responsibility. while there are a few zealots amongst the dromites who dream of a better time, when they were all united as one mind.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations</strong>&nbsp;The dromites get along splendidly with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling\">halflings</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome\">gnomes</a>&nbsp;most of all, and the jovial ways of both&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/xeph/\">xephs</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-elf\">half-elves</a>&nbsp;tends to put dromites at ease. The cold, distant, ways of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/ophiduan/\">ophiduans</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/maenad/\">maenads</a>&nbsp;make the dromites curious, wishing to prod and experiment with them, to find out the reasons for their demeanors. Most other races are viewed by their individual means, but most dromites find the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf\">dwarves</a>&nbsp;to be dull, boring and when drunk &ndash; gruff and coarse.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment and Religion</strong>&nbsp;Most dromites are religiously indiscriminate, finding grace and faith in a number of gods, sometimes part of the same pantheon, sometimes creating their own mixes of gods and faiths.

A dromite always deals the kind of energy damage that its chitin has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance\">resistance</a>&nbsp;to (for example, a dromite who has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance\">resistance</a>&nbsp;to cold 5 deals cold damage with its energy ray). The manifester level for this effect is equal to 1/2 the dromite&rsquo;s level (minimum 1st).</li>\n<li>Scent (Ex): This special quality allows a dromite to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Dromites with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-\">scent</a>&nbsp;ability can identify&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/familiar\">familiar</a>&nbsp;odors just as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human\">humans</a>&nbsp;do&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/animals/familiar\">familiar</a>&nbsp;sights. Dromites can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/troglodyte\">troglodyte</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Stench-Ex-\">stench</a>, can be detected at triple normal range. When a dromite detects a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent\">scent</a>, the exact location of the source is not revealed&mdash;only its presence somewhere within range. The dromite can take a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;to note the direction of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent\">scent</a>. When the dromite is within 5 feet of the source, it pinpoints the source&rsquo;s location. A dromite with the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry&rsquo;s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;skill. Dromites tracking by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent\">scent</a>&nbsp;ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.</li>\n<li>Compound Eyes: Dromites receive a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus\">racial bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\">Perception</a>&nbsp;checks.</li>\n<li>Psionic Aptitude: When a dromite takes a level in a favored class, it can choose to gain an additional power point instead of a hit point or skill point.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Alternate_Racial_Traits\">Alternate Racial Traits</span></h3>\n<p>The following racial traits replace existing dromite racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Atavistic Link (Su): Some dromites still have traces of their ancestral hive-mind link, making them more receptive to telepathic communication. Although a dromite with this trait cannot directly initiate telepathic contact via this trait (it still may normally via any other telepathic powers or abilities), it is easier for another to telepathically communicate with the dromite. Any use of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;power by someone else which targets only the dromite costs 1 power point less for the manifester (to a minimum of 0). This reduction in cost applies even to hostile&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;powers targeting the dromite. The dromite may also be added to a Collective without counting against the Collective&rsquo;s membership limit. This trait replaces the Dromite<br />Psionics trait.</li>\n<li>Crafter: Natural excavators, some dromites excel at turning the raw materials they remove from the earth into finished goods. Dromites with this trait gain a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus\">racial bonus</a>&nbsp;on any one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a>&nbsp;skill. This bonus improves to +4 if the dromite has at least 10 ranks in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a>&nbsp;skill. This trait replaces the Dromite Psionics trait.</li>\n<li>Excavator: As a caste-based society, some dromites are bred to remove the rubble and debris as tunnels are dug. Dromites with this trait treat their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;as 4 higher for the purposes of carrying capacity and gain the Slow and Steady speed (as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf\">dwarf</a>&nbsp;racial ability). This trait replaces the Dromite Psionics trait.</li>\n<li>Gendered: Some dromites have a gender, allowing them to become a Hive Queen or Consort. Dromites with this racial trait gain a +3 bonus to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy\">Diplomacy</a>&nbsp;checks on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/dromites/\">dromites</a>. This trait replaces the Dromite Psionics trait.</li>\n<li>Hive Mind: Dromite hive living can result in a mental link among the members. A dromite with this trait gains mindlink as a psi-like ability usable at will. This trait replaces the Dromite Psionics and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Scent-Ex-\">Scent</a>&nbsp;traits.</li>\n<li>Hive Soldier: There are many predators within the bowels of the earth. A dromite with this trait has chitin with sharpened edges instead of being hardened, granting two claw attacks. These are primary&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural attacks</a>&nbsp;that deal 1d3 points points of slashing damage. This trait replaces the Chitin trait.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Favored_Class_Options\">Favored Class Options</span></h3>\n<p>Instead of receiving an additional skill rank or hit point whenever they gain a level in a favored class, dromites have the option of choosing from a number of other bonuses, depending upon their favored classes. The following options are available to all dromites who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the listed favored class reward.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/classes/aegis/\">Aegis</a>: Add +1/4 to the dromite&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor bonus</a>&nbsp;from his astral suit.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/classes/cryptic/\">Cryptic</a>: Add +1/2 to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disable-device\">Disable Device</a>&nbsp;checks the cryptic makes against traps.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/classes/psion\">Psion</a>: Add +1 to the dromite&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance\">energy resistance</a>&nbsp;from its chitin racial ability to a maximum +10, after which the dromite may choose a different energy type to gain the +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance\">energy resistance</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/classes/tactician/\">Tactician</a>&nbsp;: Add +1/2 to the maximum number of creatures allowed in the tactician&rsquo;s collective.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/classes/vitalist\">Vitalist</a>: Add +1/2 to the maximum number of creatures allowed in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/classes/vitalist\">vitalist&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;collective</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/classes/wilder\">Wilder</a>: Add +1/3 to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/classes/wilder\">wilder&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;saving throws against effects with a type matching the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/classes/wilder\">wilder&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance\">energy resistance</a>&nbsp;gained from the chitin racial trait.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[{"_id":"sxjfxyok","formula":"2","operator":"add","target":"ability","subTarget":"cha","modifier":"untyped","priority":0,"value":2},{"_id":"4j6nqh90","formula":"2","operator":"add","target":"ability","subTarget":"dex","modifier":"untyped","priority":0,"value":2},{"_id":"q87171od","formula":"-2","operator":"add","target":"ability","subTarget":"str","modifier":"untyped","priority":0,"value":-2},{"_id":"5jijxohr","formula":"1","operator":"add","target":"ac","subTarget":"nac","modifier":"untyped","priority":0,"value":1},{"_id":"gnb28pbh","formula":"2","operator":"add","target":"skill","subTarget":"skill.per","modifier":"racial","priority":0,"value":0}],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[]},"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"creatureType":"humanoid","subTypes":[["insectoid"]],"uses":{"value":0,"max":0},"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]}},"flags":{},"img":"icons/environment/creatures/bug-larva-orange.webp","effects":[],"_id":"Z6IV9KQHDr1W0UZm"}

They gain +2 Strength and +2 Intelligence but suffer &ndash;4 Charisma.</li>\n<li><strong>Size</strong>: Forgeborn are Medium creatures and have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li>\n<li><strong>Type</strong>: Forgeborn are of the humanoid type, with the half-construct and forgeborn subtypes.</li>\n<li><strong>Speed</strong>: Forgeborn have a base speed of 20 feet, but their speed is never modified by armor or encumbrance. They have the slow and steady racial trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Languages</strong>: Forgeborn begin play speaking Common and Forgeborn. Forgeborn with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Dwarven, Elven, Maenad, Ophiduan, Xeph. See the Linguistics skill page for more information about these languages.</li>\n<li><strong>Half-Contructs:&nbsp;</strong>Half-constructs gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against disease, mind-affecting effects, poison, and effects that cause either exhaustion or fatigue. They do not breathe, eat, or sleep, unless they want to gain some beneficial effect from one of these activities. This means that a half-construct can drink potions to benefit from their effects and can sleep in order to regain spells, but neither of these activities is required for the construct to survive or stay in good health.</li>\n<li><strong>Fearless</strong>: Forgeborn gain a +2 bonus to saving throws against fear effects.</li>\n<li><strong>Natural Armor</strong>: Forgeborn are sturdier than other races and gain a +1 natural armor bonus to their AC.</li>\n<li><strong>Source Crystal</strong>: Unlike most half-constructs, forgeborn can be raised and resurrected.</li>\n<li><strong>Naturally Psionic</strong>: Forgeborn gain the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/wild-talent\">Wild Talent</a> feat as a bonus feat at 1st level.

A forgeborn with this trait gains a +2 bonus to its AC against ray attacks. In addition, once per day it can deflect one ray as an immediate action. This replaces natural armor.</li>\n<li><strong>Memory Matrix</strong>: There are some forgeborn who are created with an intuitive knack for knowledge or industry. A forgeborn with this trait picks a single Craft, Knowledge, or Profession skill. The forgeborn gains a +2 bonus to this skill and it is always a class skill. This ability replaces fearless.</li>\n<li><strong>Oreheart</strong>: A forgeborn with this trait can be raised and resurrected, but can also be healed by repair effects such as reconstruction as if it were a construct. The forgeborn heals only half as much from healing effects (other than effects which work on constructs, such as fast healing and repair effects) and takes only half damage from negative energy effects. This ability replaces source crystal.</li>\n<li><strong>Quickened Steps</strong>: Although most forgeborn are steady in their gait, some are designed for speed. Forgeborn with this trait have a speed of 30 ft. This replaces slow and steady and fearless.</li>\n<li><strong>Second Skin</strong>: Not all forgeborn have a natrually tough exterior, but instead are extremely comfortable in armor. A forgeborn with this trait reduces any armor check penalty from armor worn by 1 (to a minimum of 0) and can sleep in medium or heavy metal armor without suffering ill effects from sleeping in armor. This replaces natural armor.</li>\n<li><strong>Strange Mind</strong>: The process of death and rebirth as a forgeborn can sometimes warp the mind of the new forgeborn. A forgeborn with this trait gains a +2 bonus to Will-saves and an additional +2 bonus against illusion spells or effects. This replaces natural armor.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Racial Variants</h2>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span id=\"Champion_Forgeborn_Racial_Variant\">Champion</span></span></h3>\n<p>When deciding upon the perfect soldier, it is common for many to look towards inspiration rather than martial skill. Champions are the icons of this philosophy, machine warriors designed to be the ultimate beacon of hope for a force that will remain strong even in truly dire situations. Utilized as performers, guards, and commanders, these champions are the faces of many a mechanical force.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ability Score Modifiers</strong>: Champions do not have much regarding information programming but compensate for it with their indomitable bodies and spirits. This ability replaces the forgeborn&rsquo;s normal ability score modifications. They gain +2 Constitution, +2 Charisma, but suffer -2 Intelligence.</li>\n<li><strong>Incredible Resolve</strong>: The champion&rsquo;s bonuses to saving throws vs. fear, exhaustion, fatigue, and mind-affecting effects increases by 1. This ability replaces natural armor.</li>\n<li><strong>Beacon of Hope</strong>: Once per day, a champion may increase all morale bonuses it provides by 1 for a number of rounds equal to its charisma modifier (minimum 1). This ability replaces Naturally Psionic and Psionic Aptitude.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><span id=\"Champion_Forgeborn_Racial_Variant\">Processor</span></span></h3>\n<p>To a wise man, a potent scholastic is a valuable tool, more versatile and dangerous than any weapon.<u> </u>Hence, many wealthy individuals enlist the greatest artificers of their realm to create servitors with flawless memories and expert learning capacity, artificial marvels that can always discern what lies around the corner.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Ability Score Modifiers</strong> +4 Intelligence, -2 Dexterity, -2 Constitution. Processors are unrivaled in brilliance but were not designed for combat or movement. This ability replaces the forgeborn&rsquo;s normal ability score modifiers.</li>\n<li><strong>Speed</strong>: Processors are not agile or flexible and have a base speed of 20 feet. This ability replaces slow and steady.</li>\n<li><strong>Lorekeeper</strong>: Processors possess perfect recall and can invoke any sort of information with ease. They treat all knowledge skills as class skills and can take 10 on any intelligence-based skill checks. This ability replaces natural armor.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Aegis</strong>: Add +1/4 to customization points.</li>\n<li><strong>Barbarian</strong>: Add 1 to the total number of rage rounds per day.</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptic</strong>: Add +1/4 to the damage reduction gained from altered defense.</li>\n<li><strong>Dread </strong>: Add +1/2 to Intimidate checks.</li>\n<li><strong>Fighter</strong>: Add +1 to CMD against disarm and sunder attempts.</li>\n<li><strong>Paladin</strong>: Add +1 to saves against negative energy effects.</li>\n<li><strong>Psychic Warrior</strong>: Add +1/2 to concentration checks when manifesting psychic warrior powers.</li>\n<li><strong>Rogue</strong>: Add +1/2 to Disable Device checks.</li>\n<li><strong>Soulknife</strong>: Add +1/2 to CMB when attempting a disarm or sunder.</li>\n<li><strong>Tactician </strong>: Add +1/2 to concentration checks when manifesting tactician powers.</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[{"id":"6jKtAzq0EsWo7pvu","dataType":"data","name":"Ability Score Modifiers (Forgeborn)","img":"Race_Forgeborn.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":0},{"id":"FkRNWLTMLILPhdws","dataType":"data","name":"Base Speed (Forgeborn)","img":"Race_Forgeborn.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":1},{"id":"INYMUvaYSWa8jI5p","dataType":"data","name":"Fearless (Forgeborn)","img":"Race_Forgeborn.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":2},{"id":"NnfHOFJJkflb9dGM","dataType":"data","name":"Half-Constructs (Forgeborn)","img":"Race_Forgeborn.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":3},{"id":"6VSwHs4Iybok3Nyo","dataType":"data","name":"Languages (Forgeborn)","img":"Race_Forgeborn.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":4},{"id":"e0flvub4e85ICw98","dataType":"data","name":"Natural Armor (Forgeborn)","img":"Race_Forgeborn.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":5},{"id":"tttPcISSIhSE5gdS","dataType":"data","name":"Naturally Psionic (Forgeborn)","img":"Race_Forgeborn.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":6},{"id":"9sGmRhULHSd0hQCl","dataType":"data","name":"Psionic Aptitude (Forgeborn)","img":"Race_Forgeborn.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":7},{"id":"9IBHLfUxnAw8f3P9","dataType":"data","name":"Race Power Points (Forgeborn)","img":"Race_Forgeborn.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":8},{"id":"vFYfXkkPICOiyzPx","dataType":"data","name":"Size (Forgeborn)","img":"Race_Forgeborn.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":9},{"id":"ugx9APF8RO7lJgFN","dataType":"data","name":"Source Crystal (Forgeborn)","img":"Race_Forgeborn.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":10},{"id":"XOiWomvc1bVOyXZF","dataType":"data","name":"Type (Forgeborn)","img":"Race_Forgeborn.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":11}]},"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"creatureType":"humanoid","subTypes":[["half-construct"],["forgeborn"]],"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"heroes-for-hire","system":"pf1","coreVersion":"0.7.9","systemVersion":"0.76.13"}},"img":"Race_Forgeborn.webp","effects":[],"_id":"g8ZIyPqO742cgepY"}

They suffer a -1 penalty to Charisma-based skill checks when dealing with non-elans.</li>\n<li><strong>Naturally Psionic</strong>: Elans gain the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/wild-talent\">Wild Talent</a> feat as a bonus feat at 1st level. If an elan takes levels in a psionic class, she instead gains the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/psionic-talent-psionic\">Psionic Talent</a> feat.</li>\n<li><strong>Resistance (Su)</strong>: Elans can use psionic energy to increase their resistance to various forms of attack. As an immediate action, an elan can spend 1 power point to gain a +4 racial bonus on saving throws until the beginning of her next action.</li>\n<li><strong>Resilience (Su)</strong>: When an elan takes damage, he can spend power points to reduce its severity. As an immediate action, he can reduce the damage he is about to take by 2 hit points for every 1 power point he spends.</li>\n<li><strong>Repletion (Su)</strong>: An elan can sustain his body without need of food or water. If he spends 1 power point, an elan does not need to eat or drink for 24 hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Psionic Aptitude</strong>: When an elan takes a level in a favored class, he can choose to gain an additional power point instead of a hit point or skill point.</li>\n<li><strong>Languages</strong>: Elans begin play speaking Common. Elans with high Intelligence scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic).</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Failed Transformation</strong>: It is incredibly rare, but sometimes, the transformation into an elan does not complete as expected. Elans with this trait gain the following benefit based upon their original race and lose the repletion, resilience, and resistance traits. In addition, the elan suffers a -2 penalty to Charisma-based skills and checks against elans.\n<ul>\n<li><em>Blue</em> The elan gains the darkvision and small traits of the blue, but retains the normal speed of the elan.</li>\n<li><em>Dromite</em>: The elan gains the chitin trait of the dromite.</li>\n<li><em>Duergar</em>: The elan gains the darkvision and slow and steady traits of the duergar.</li>\n<li><em>Dwarf</em>: The elan gains the darkvision and slow and steady traits of the dwarf.</li>\n<li><em>Elf</em>: The elan gains the low-light vision and Elven Immunities traits of the elf.</li>\n<li><em>Gnome</em>: The elan gains the low-light vision and Keen Senses traits of the gnome.</li>\n<li><em>Half-Elf</em>: The elan gains the adaptability and low-light vision traits of the half-elf.</li>\n<li><em>Half-Giant</em>: The elan gains the fire Acclimated and low-light vision traits of the half-giant.</li>\n<li><em>Half-orc</em>: The elan gains the darkvision and Ferocity traits of the half-orc.</li>\n<li><em>Halfling</em>: The elan gains the halfling luck and keen senses traits of the halfling.</li>\n<li><em>Human</em>: The elan gains the skilled trait of the human.</li>\n<li><em>Maenad</em>: The elan gains the sonic affinity and outburst traits of the maenad.</li>\n<li><em>Ophiduan</em>: The elan gains the scaled hide and Poison Resistant traits of the ophiduan.</li>\n<li><em>Xeph</em>: The elan gains the darkvision and Burst traits of the xeph, but may only use Burst once per day.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Haughty</strong>: As psionically-endowed beings, some elans consider themselves better than non-elans. This arrogance grants them a toughened will. An elan with this trait gains a +2 racial bonus to saves against mind-affecting effects but suffers a -2 penalty to Charisma-based skill checks when dealing with non-elans. This trait replaces the Aberrant Nature and Resistance traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Reconstruction (Su)</strong>: Some elans are more adept at psionically rebuilding bodies than preserving them. These elans may spend 1 or more pp as a swift action to gain Fast Healing 2 for a number of rounds equal to the number of pp spent; this can be used even when unconscious. The elan also gains a +1 bonus to its manifester level when manifesting powers of the Healing subdiscipline. This replaces resistance and resilience.</li>\n<li><strong>Smooth Talker</strong>: Elans seek to hide their nature from others. Some may have been created for the purpose of hiding their nature and achieving positions of power or trust. Elans with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus to Charisma-based skill checks against non-mindless creatures. This trait replaces the aberrant nature and repletion traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Strong Blooded</strong>: Some elans have a small portion of their original racial characteristics survive the transformation process.

{"_id":"kITc6X3BCoIuagNP","name":"Ophiduan","permission":{"default":0,"MsPD2JVY26a5XrG4":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Confused with lizardfolk by the ignorant, ophiduans stand out among the other civilized nations in a fashion similar to the dromites, having a more monstrous and distinct appearance than most humanoids. Where other races share soft skin, flat teeth, protruding ears, and a tendency to be partially or fully covered in hair, ophiduans are distinct and very proud of it. Organized and expansionistic in nature, ophiduans view talent and skill, especially with psionics, as the key component for social station, rather than wealth, heritage, or influence.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description</strong>&nbsp;Reptilian scales cover the ophiduans&rsquo; hairless bodies, and their yellow, slitted eyes and sharp teeth give them a striking appearance. They stand tall, often a head above most humans, but are typically slimmer than humans, being lithe in build. Ophiduans have no ears, and their ridged brows are often what define their face. Most ophiduans are green-scaled, but there are those of blue, purple, black, or yellow in tone, a trait which is passed along to progeny. The only common color among all ophiduans is the dull grey of their stomachs, which reflects their common ancestry.</p>\n<p><strong>Society</strong>&nbsp;Ophiduans are sometimes viewed as being cold in personality because they are reptilian in nature, but that does not define their society. Rather, a strong meritocracy defines them; to an ophiduan, leadership is constantly earned, as are most things in life. Respect, money, and friends, all are earned and the ophiduan society reflects this. There is very little compassion towards strangers, even within a society, but friends and family are expected to sacrifice for one another. Ophiduans tend not to be satisfied with themselves, feeling a drive to become better, seeking the elusive state of perfection. A leader amongst the ophiduans is often a very capable politician, a warrior, and psionically gifted, for otherwise he or she would not have risen to such a position, as he or she would not have proven capable of leading. This results in the ophiduan societies tendency to become organized and expansionistic in nature, as they strive to improve their cities, lands, and surrounding areas. Sometimes they expand by war, sometimes by politics, but never does an ophiduan society find any form of calm or stability, for it is always seeking to become better, trying to become perfect.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations</strong>&nbsp;Ophiduans view most other races as strange, sometimes even soft. The whimsical ways of gnomes and halflings tend to irritate them, humans seem to constantly shift between their goals, and half-elves seem to be confused about who they are. Ophiduans can respect the dedication of the elves, but cannot relate to their perceived inactivity and slow-acting ways. Dwarves impress the ophiduans with their ability to build lasting empires and their perfection of the crafts, but their inability to adapt and to strive forward annoys them. Half-orcs and half-giants, strangely enough, are often appreciated, for if anything they tend to be direct and strive towards action, something ophiduans can appreciate. Xeph are valued for their individual philosophy, but disdained as a society for their seeming acceptance to maintain what they have and not to improve or expand. Dromites are appreciated for they too have a constant drive towards a goal. Few ophiduans know what elans are and thus have no specific relations to them.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment and Religion&nbsp;</strong>Ophiduans tend to revere their greatest leaders as gods in the flesh, although they never go so far as to actually worship them; rather an ophiduan will follow the great leader and be inspired. The gods of other races and religions are therefore also viewed like this, as representations of great individuals to be admired, aspired towards, and emulated.

Dromites with high Intelligence scores can choose from the following: Dwarven, Gnome, Goblin, and Terran.</li>\n<li><strong>Chitin</strong>: Dromites receive a +1 natural armor bonus and one of the following kinds of energy resistance of their choice at creation: cold 5, electricity 5, fire 5, or sonic 5. This choice is permanent and stacks with any future energy resistance gained through other effects.</li>\n<li><strong>Naturally Psionic</strong>: Dromites gain the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/wild-talent\">Wild Talent</a> feat as a bonus feat at 1st level. If a dromite takes levels in a psionic class, he instead gains the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/psionic-talent-psionic\">Psionic Talent</a> feat.</li>\n<li><strong>Dromite Psionics</strong>: Dromites gain the following psi-like ability: 1/day&mdash;<em>energy ray</em>. A dromite always deals the kind of energy damage that its chitin has resistance to (for example, a dromite who has resistance to cold 5 deals cold damage with its energy ray). The manifester level for this effect is equal to 1/2 the dromite&rsquo;s level (minimum 1st).</li>\n<li><strong>Scent (Ex)</strong>: This special quality allows a dromite to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Dromites with the scent ability can identify familiar odors just as humans do familiar sights. Dromites can detect opponents within 30 feet by sense of smell. If the opponent is upwind, the range increases to 60 feet; if downwind, it drops to 15 feet. Strong scents, such as smoke or rotting garbage, can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering scents, such as skunk musk or troglodyte stench, can be detected at triple normal range. When a dromite detects a scent, the exact location of the source is not revealed&mdash;only its presence somewhere within range. The dromite can take a move action to note the direction of the scent. When the dromite is within 5 feet of the source, it pinpoints the source&rsquo;s location. A dromite with the scent ability can follow tracks by smell, making a Wisdom (or Survival) check to find or follow a track. The typical DC for a fresh trail is 10 (no matter what kind of surface holds the scent). This DC increases or decreases depending on how strong the quarry&rsquo;s odor is, the number of creatures, and the age of the trail. For each hour that the trail is cold, the DC increases by 2. The ability otherwise follows the rules for the Survival skill. Dromites tracking by scent ignore the effects of surface conditions and poor visibility.</li>\n<li><strong>Compound Eyes</strong>: Dromites receive a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks.</li>\n<li><strong>Psionic Aptitude</strong>: When a dromite takes a level in a favored class, it can choose to gain an additional power point instead of a hit point or skill point.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr style=\"font-size: 14px;\" />\n<h2>Alternate Racial Traits</h2>\n<ul style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\n<li><strong>Atavistic Link (Su)</strong>: Some dromites still have traces of their ancestral hive-mind link, making them more receptive to telepathic communication. Although a dromite with this trait cannot directly initiate telepathic contact via this trait (it still may normally via any other telepathic powers or abilities), it is easier for another to telepathically communicate with the dromite. Any use of a mind-affecting power by someone else which targets only the dromite costs 1 power point less for the manifester (to a minimum of 0). This reduction in cost applies even to hostile mind-affecting powers targeting the dromite. The dromite may also be added to a Collective without counting against the Collective&rsquo;s membership limit. This trait replaces the Dromite <br />Psionics trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Crafter</strong>: Natural excavators, some dromites excel at turning the raw materials they remove from the earth into finished goods. Dromites with this trait gain a +2 racial bonus on any one Craft skill. This bonus improves to +4 if the dromite has at least 10 ranks in the Craft skill. This trait replaces the Dromite Psionics trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Excavator</strong>: As a caste-based society, some dromites are bred to remove the rubble and debris as tunnels are dug. Dromites with this trait treat their Strength as 4 higher for the purposes of carrying capacity and gain the Slow and Steady speed (as the dwarf racial ability). This trait replaces the Dromite Psionics trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Gendered</strong>: Some dromites have a gender, allowing them to become a Hive Queen or Consort. Dromites with this racial trait gain a +3 bonus to Diplomacy checks on dromites. This trait replaces the Dromite Psionics trait.</li>\n<li><strong>Hive Mind</strong>: Dromite hive living can result in a mental link among the members. A dromite with this trait gains mindlink as a psi-like ability usable at will. This trait replaces the Dromite Psionics and Scent traits.</li>\n<li><strong>Hive Soldier</strong>: There are many predators within the bowels of the earth. A dromite with this trait has chitin with sharpened edges instead of being hardened, granting two claw attacks. These are primary natural attacks that deal 1d3 points points of slashing damage. This trait replaces the Chitin trait.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr style=\"font-size: 14px;\" />\n<h2>Favored Class Options</h2>\n<ul style=\"font-size: 14px;\">\n<li><strong>Aegis</strong>: Add +1/4 to the dromite&rsquo;s armor bonus from his astral suit.</li>\n<li><strong>Cryptic</strong>: Add +1/2 to Disable Device checks the cryptic makes against traps.</li>\n<li><strong>Psion</strong>: Add +1 to the dromite&rsquo;s energy resistance from its chitin racial ability to a maximum +10, after which the dromite may choose a different energy type to gain the +1 energy resistance.</li>\n<li><strong>Tactician </strong>: Add +1/2 to the maximum number of creatures allowed in the tactician&rsquo;s collective.</li>\n<li><strong>Vitalist</strong>: Add +1/2 to the maximum number of creatures allowed in the vitalist&rsquo;s collective</li>\n<li><strong>Wilder</strong>: Add +1/3 to the wilder&rsquo;s saving throws against effects with a type matching the wilder&rsquo;s energy resistance gained from the chitin racial trait.</li>\n<li>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"tags":[],"changes":[],"changeFlags":{"loseDexToAC":false,"noStr":false,"noDex":false,"oneInt":false,"oneWis":false,"oneCha":false,"noEncumbrance":false,"mediumArmorFullSpeed":false,"heavyArmorFullSpeed":false},"contextNotes":[],"links":{"children":[{"id":"w6dsBZGVruFEMDaS","dataType":"data","name":"Ability Score Modifiers (Dromite)","img":"Race_Dromite.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":0},{"id":"oElr0fdcbOqp1aOC","dataType":"data","name":"Base Speed (Dromite)","img":"Race_Dromite.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":1},{"id":"IpjTmIpOmCo8XHur","dataType":"data","name":"Compound Eyes (Dromite)","img":"Race_Dromite.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":2},{"id":"CFsl7WlrcGy7rcl5","dataType":"data","name":"Dromite Psionics (Dromite)","img":"Race_Dromite.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":3},{"id":"Heg9vhqYmrwA3F44","dataType":"data","name":"Languages (Dromite)","img":"Race_Dromite.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":4},{"id":"meFrnvV0Ik0zVEUb","dataType":"data","name":"Naturally Psionic (Dromite)","img":"Race_Dromite.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":5},{"id":"hs23dqRx8HCZox3c","dataType":"data","name":"Psionic Aptitude (Dromite)","img":"Race_Dromite.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":6},{"id":"5kcNc03zIhGKw37D","dataType":"data","name":"Race Power Points (Dromite)","img":"Race_Dromite.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":7},{"id":"IPollvCNhbYo24ze","dataType":"data","name":"Scent (Ex) (Dromite)","img":"Race_Dromite.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":8},{"id":"q7mSJcD5O3cndxmU","dataType":"data","name":"Size (Dromite)","img":"Race_Dromite.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":9},{"id":"5EVpiTvalfkMn5kC","dataType":"data","name":"Type (Dromite)","img":"Race_Dromite.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":10},{"id":"yCGWBOC3RqmnSBgk","dataType":"data","name":"Chitin type (Dromite)","img":"Race_Dromite.webp","hiddenLinks":{},"_index":11}]},"armorProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"weaponProf":{"value":[],"custom":""},"creatureType":"humanoid","subTypes":[["insectoid"]],"damage":{"parts":[],"critParts":[],"nonCritParts":[]},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0}},"flags":{"exportSource":{"world":"heroes-for-hire","system":"pf1","coreVersion":"0.7.9","systemVersion":"0.76.13"}},"img":"Race_Dromite.webp","effects":[],"_id":"nf1tuhgwQ4bQhQ1Q"}
{"name":"Elan","permission":{"default":0,"MsPD2JVY26a5XrG4":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Born not of a mother or father, but created, elans were once mortal beings. Built by a shadowy council to live as psionically awakened superior life forms, elans are capable of sustaining themselves with nothing but the power of the mind. Elans are no longer true mortals, having been unfettered by a secret ritual that created this new race and reborn anew, with but wisps and fragments of memories of their previous lives. Incapable of breeding, elans expand their numbers by choosing members of other races, most often&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human\">humans</a>, and transforming them into new elans. This would pose a problem for the continuation of the race, except elans do not die of old age. The secrets of the transformation ritual are typically limited to the elite members of the elan secret society that exists, and they take these secrets to the grave before sharing them with lesser beings. Elans are often chosen for being exceptional in some way: sometimes it is because they excel in physical challenges, other times it is because of their quick wit or sharp intellect, or in some cases a natural ability to work with the psionic arts. But none of the elans could ever be described as normal, mediocre, or standard. While most elans, even those of non-human origin, physically resemble humans, there is usually something that stands out about every elan.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description</strong>&nbsp;With a diverse physical makeup, dependent on the will and whim of the council, there is one thing in common amongst all elans: they are literally brimming with energy, psionic energy. Their eyes seem to shine, their skin seems to sparkle, and their hair seems to be made of strands of color in the wind. Elans typically resemble humans in size and weight, with males typically slightly taller and heavier than females. Even those elans who were selected from other races will be transformed to more closely match humans in size and shape, at the direction of the council. Elans under a particular council will tend to have similar physical appearance, with the previous council favoring pale skin, red hair, and young in appearance, while the current council has started to favor darker hair and tanned skin. Elans will adopt the type of dress and physical style of whatever society they are insinuating, the better to avoid detection.</p>\n<p>Elans do not sleep as mortals do, instead entering a deep meditative trance for 4 hours a day. Resting in this fashion grants the elan the same benefits that other races gain from 8 hours of sleep. The elan spends the time in this trance renewing her body by suffusing it with psionic energy, repairing wounds, and keeping the tissues and organs healthy.</p>\n<p><strong>Society</strong>&nbsp;While few and far between, there is indeed an elan society, but it is more akin to the structure of a secret society. Elans tend to recognize one another at sight, but others can have a hard time separating them from normal races. In cities and places where many people gather, elans will generally strive to find a way to meet each other, often in secret to avoid implicating each other or raising suspicions. Elans come together to share wisdom, to learn, and to help their peers. Often this learning is defined into layers, circles, strata, or other forms of separation, which leads to a mysticism surrounding the societies of elans. Sometimes elans name their order after something symbolical, such as the Brotherhood of the Heavenly Lantern; at other times it is more direct, such as the Enlightened Order of Ksaren. Elans, if anything, are infiltrators, preferring to live within the societies of others, striving to become part of their culture and ways, avoiding standing out and gaining unwanted attention. Many elans become wanderers because over time, others may take notice that the elan does not age and start to ask questions. For this reason, elans can be said to be nomadic, albeit at a very long cycle. Little is known to non-elans about the council that selects and transforms mortals into new elans, even new elans may not know all the members of the council, as a precaution from discovery from outsiders. New elans are typically chosen, although rare cases of mortals petitioning the elan council for transformation have occurred.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations</strong>&nbsp;Coming from a diverse range of races, the elans will look for the individual rather than the race. They know that they, as a race, are created for their individual characteristics rather than their racial background, and because of this, they can seem to treat members of other races unevenly, being friendly to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/half-orc\">half-orcs</a>, joking with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf\">dwarves</a>, and stern and distant towards&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling\">halflings</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome\">gnomes</a>. This is only an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Illusion\">illusion</a>&nbsp;of perception, for it is the individual that is treated, not the race itself. For this reason, elans are both loved and despised; they break stereotypes in ways that often make them stand out like a sore thumb.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment and Religion</strong>&nbsp;Those elans who do embrace a religion tend to revere gods of psionics or the mind. Being composed and enlightened does not necessarily carry with it any specific moral views, and for this reason, there are elans of every kind of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>. Many tend over time to drift towards lawful neutral, finding an ease with laws and regulations, but not caring deeply for or against other people, preferring solitude. Younger elans embrace everything on the alignment spectrum, sometimes radically changing moral compass in an attempt to find their way on their new journey on the road of immortality.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers</strong>&nbsp;As natural nomads, and often culled from a naturally inquisitive and curious mindset, elans are explorers. Exploring allows them to challenge themselves and therefore grow and develop in their abilities.

{"_id":"tOD78q0oX0uZMvHC","name":"Duergar [PSI]","permission":{"default":0,"MsPD2JVY26a5XrG4":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>There are stories of those who dug too deep into the bowels of the earth, spelunkers who opened ancient cities and awakened things from beyond our worst nightmares. There these miners discovered creatures more akin to gods sleeping beneath the earth, beings neither demonic nor angelic in their forms and minds. There was a clan of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf\">dwarves</a>&nbsp;who cast all caution aside, tunneling deep, following richer and richer mineral veins until they found something that shattered their minds, broke their bodies, and remade them in a new image. What returned from that unknown place where logic no longer made sense, where the laws of physics did not always hold sway, and the weak minds of the current races couldn&rsquo;t fathom were the duergars, who warned of a slumbering deity who would rule over all other deities if awakened. Duergars are reminiscent of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf\">dwarves</a>&nbsp;they once were, in that they are short and broad, of powerful stature, but that is where any likeness is lost. Their ways can seem to be callous and cruel, but it is from their experience deep in the earth that they are motivated. Even actions such as slavery are not only acceptable but encouraged if it helps to continue the projects that keep That Which Sleeps Beneath from arising.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description</strong>&nbsp;Duergars&rsquo; eyes shine with a madness that has touched their entire bloodline. Their ashen skin is devoid of nearly all hair, except on their head and face, although male duergars tend to have a bald pate. While short and broad, standing roughly 4 1/2 feet tall, the rippling muscles of the duergars make most people uneasy, for beneath their skin, the muscles move of their own accord, snaking and twisting. Many duergars have long scars, often caused by their own delusions.</p>\n<p><strong>Society</strong>&nbsp;Having witnessed what they perceive to be the truth of this world, there is no joy amongst the duergars, only eternal toil. Deep underground, deeper than the dwarven kingdoms, they toil on deranged constructions that twist and turn in ways that give others headaches and nightmares. Driven by an intense need to create and build, those who stop to listen hear the duergars humming and singing while building. The duergars themselves claim they are saving the world by distracting the terrible deity that slumbers beneath the earth, keeping it asleep for the sake of all life. Their society has no joys, no color, no individuality. Everyone wears the same clothes, the same&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, the same weapons, and by birth they seem to know the lullaby chants of the mentally unbalanced.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations&nbsp;</strong>To the duergars, it is the other races who are mad. As a terrible monster that is beyond what words can describe threatens to awaken and devour the world and the gods themselves, the other races squander their lives away, playing useless games and waging meaningless war. Xephs,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/dromites/\">dromites</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling\">halflings</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome\">gnomes</a>&nbsp;can provoke the insane rage of the duergars, for their constant activity threatens the duergar view of how to keep the titanic god sleeping. Other races are most often ignored or disdained for their failure to recognize the truth and the deadly threat. Most other races avoid the mad duergars, but there are those who wonder if the duergars might not be insane, and might actually be correct, and how terrifying that possibility might be.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment and Religion</strong>&nbsp;Almost all duergars worship the sleeping horror by working, building, constructing, and redefining, while humming and singing the twisted lullaby that runs through their minds. All other gods are inconsequential, for the horrid thing, That Which Sleeps Beneath, will consume all if it awakens. Lawful neutral, or perhaps lawful evil, tend to be the natural tendencies of the duergars, for they see no use in helping others with their pointless daily problems when they are busy saving the world from the threat of imminent destruction.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers</strong>&nbsp;Duergars only become adventurers because their unique brand of insanity plagues them with visions and whispers of the peace that others have in their heads. Driven by a need to fulfill these visions and quiet the voices within, duergars often seem obsessed with what they are doing. While capable companions, many are scared to adventure with duergars, for their tendency to whisper in their sleep and their skin&rsquo;s unusual undulations can be unnerving.</p>\n<p><strong>Note On Names</strong>&nbsp;Duergars abstain from traditional naming conventions, often viewing names as a pointless exercise in a doomed world. When young, they are &lsquo;child,&rsquo; and then become &lsquo;woman&rsquo; and &lsquo;man&rsquo;. Amongst the other races, they often take on a name because their companions ask them to; this name is often matter-of-fact and describes their perceived role in the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Names</strong>&nbsp;Hammer, Smith, War, Hunter, Tailor, Shieldbearer, Slayer, Hatemonger</p>\n<div>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"><caption>Table: Random Starting Ages</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Adulthood</th>\n<th>Intuitive1</th>\n<th>Self-Taught2</th>\n<th>Trained3</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>40 years</td>\n<td>+3d6 years (43-52 years)</td>\n<td>+5d6 years (45-70 years)</td>\n<td>+7d6 years (47-82 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>1&nbsp;This category includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian\">barbarians</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle\">oracles</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue\">rogues</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerers</a>.<br />2&nbsp;This category includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard\">bards</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/cavalier\">cavaliers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighters</a>, gunslingers,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin\">paladins</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger\">rangers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner\">summoners</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch\">witches</a>.<br />3&nbsp;This category includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist\">alchemists</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">clerics</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druids</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor\">inquisitors</a>, magi,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monks</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizards</a>.</p>\n<div>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"><caption>Table: Random Height and Weight</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Gender</th>\n<th>Base Height</th>\n<th>Height Modifier</th>\n<th>Base Weight</th>\n<th>Weight Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Male</td>\n<td>3 ft. 9 in.</td>\n<td>+2d4 in.

{"name":"Noral","permission":{"default":0,"MsPD2JVY26a5XrG4":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The norals are a race of humanoids with a symbiotic bond with the erliss, a small psionic creature also referred to as a dreamscar. Norals that have bonded with an erliss no longer dream, giving the creature its nickname, as well as giving the bonded norals the nickname of the dreamscarred. The symbiotic joining process has left the noral race open to the benefit of other creatures on their society, making them more likely to seek out information on other cultures and talented at social interactions.</p>\n<p>Known for being physically clumsier than most, some surmise that norals lack agility because the bonding process has impacted their natural reflexes. Others argue it is because the race has a naturally stocky frame that simply does not lend itself well to precise movements. Despite this, the natural resiliency of their mental and physical forms has helped them overcome what is otherwise a liability for surviving the harsh lands near their settlements. However, their ability to block such assaults, combined with their natural ability to assault the minds of others, has given some a fear of the race as a potential subjugator of free will, a notion the norals find ludicrous for their views on free will as something to be nurtured and never to be threatened.</p>\n<p>While some norals choose not to bond with an erliss, this is the exception, rather than the rule. The bonding process itself is done as a ceremony once a noral has reached adulthood and is considered an important step in the maturation of their younger generations. This ceremony is typically done in private, usually with only the noral&rsquo;s parents in attendance. Upon completion, the newly-dreamscarred noral is considered an adult and afforded all privileges as such.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description:</strong> Norals stand about as tall as humans, but are typically stockier in form. They have skin tones, eye color, and hair pigments of a similar range as humans, but a noral who has undergone the bonding process to become dreamscarred loses all skin and hair pigmentation, becoming an albino with pure white hair. A dreamscarred noral&rsquo;s eyes turn pure black, and the erliss at the base of their neck rapidly grows into its mature form, with four tentacles coming out of the base of the noral&rsquo;s neck, usually draping over the noral&rsquo;s shoulders. In addition, a dreamscarred noral&rsquo;s forehead and skull takes on a ridged and plated look, rather than the typical humanoid appearance. The erliss is a tentacled creature that looks something like a sea star, with four or five arms that stretch out from the central core. Most often white, pale pink, pale blue, the erliss can exist comfortably in both water and on land. The small ridges across their appendages can quickly change color, which is often used to scare away lesser predators. On the underside of the creature, there is a small mouth. One of the tentacles has a small reddish opening that can extrude the romon, a slithering tentacle used to collect food, paralyze prey and, perhaps most importantly, initiate the psychic bridge that begins the melding process. The bonding is initiated by placing the erliss on the noral&rsquo;s neck, with its mouth flush against the exposed skin of the noral, and the tentacle placed at the base of the skull.</p>\n<p><strong>Society: </strong>The societal structure of the norals is one of a democratic republic. In their society, only norals who have gone through the bonding process may vote for the Ruling Council, which then governs. Unbonded norals do not get to vote, as they are seen as still being children or outcasts, causing most young norals to seek to complete the bonding ritual or to leave for lands where such a distinction does not matter. The resistance that norals have against mental intrusion gives them a strong sense of morality when it comes to the use of compulsions or domination &ndash; be it mental or physical. This leads few to seek the use of such tactics, although those who work as mediators push the envelope by using powers that only read thoughts, arguing that since they are not compelling the subject, it is simply a better way to achieve amicable solutions, while their natural ability to attack the minds of others is viewed as a to be used only in self-defense and never as a means to impose their will.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations:</strong> The benefits the noral race derive from the erliss make them naturally inclined to seek out new cultures that might grant them improvements to their own. Their natural inclination to understand other cultures and to easily interact with other races has helped them to take on a role of mediator for conflicts, while they try to maintain neutrality. When such attempts are unsuccessful, or when the norals are cast as favoring one side over another, the norals will instead withdraw and allow the other races to resolve matters on their own, even if it results in brutal combat.</p>\n<p>Among the other races, the norals have the most difficulty working with the psionocratic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/ophiduan/\">ophiduan</a>&nbsp;race, for they see the serpentine race&rsquo;s ruling style as barbarism wrapped in a supposed enlightened form of government. In addition, some cultures, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf\">dwarves</a>, view the norals&rsquo; preference to stay out of conflicts as passively condoning the actions of their enemies, earning enmity on more than one occasion. One area where norals dislike the interactions with other races is in the proclivity of other races to kiss in public. Kissing for the norals is their means to breed more erliss, so they view such public displays as unseemly.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment and Religion:</strong> Norals worship a pantheon of deities which reflect the many facets of daily life. While they have the full spectrum of alignments within their society, the general tendency of the race is toward lawful over chaotic, as the structure of the society and the bonding process and the responsibility of breeding the erliss leads most norals to respect the rule of law and the needs for organized social structure.</p>\n<p>Adventurers: Norals who adventure are often those seeking the perceived glory of combat heard of from the other cultures they work with, or to rise in the view of society. Worldly experience, especially with other races, is prized within noral society for those seeking leadership roles. Conversely, others might go off on adventures to get away from the structure of noral society.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names:</strong> Merixal, Deridal, Codinal, Soletal.</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names:</strong> Miliac, Antiac, Carinac, Olniac.</p>\n<h3><span id=\"Rejecting_the_Dreamscar\">Rejecting the Dreamscar</span></h3>\n<p>Most every noral bonds with an erliss, gaining all the benefits of the symbiotic link in what is known as the dreamscar.

This replaces noral psionics.</li>\n<li>Symbiote Sensitivity: Some norals have an erliss that can grant the ability to detect nearby psionic activity. A noral with this trait gains detect psionics as a psi-like ability usable at will (manifester level is equal to the noral&rsquo;s character level). This replaces noral psionics.</li>\n<li>Symbiotic Sentry: Some erliss take a more passive role in protecting the noral, warning their host when subject to psychic attack. When the noral fails a Save against a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Magic-Descriptor-Mind-Affecting\">mind-affecting</a>&nbsp;effect, he may immediately roll a second Save; if the second Save is successful, he is still affected by the effect, but he is at least aware of a psychic attack and his failure to block it, even if he does not know the exact attack or its consequences (thus, he may take defensive precautions, such as manifesting dispel psionics on himself or casting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/p/protection-from-evil\">protection from evil</a>, if possible).

{"name":"Blue","permission":{"default":0,"MsPD2JVY26a5XrG4":3},"type":"race","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Once thought to be a subrace of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/goblin\">goblins</a>, blues are related to goblins, being a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Goblinoid\">goblinoid</a>&nbsp;race, but are actually defined as their own race. Able to interbreed with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/goblin\">goblins</a>, similar to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human\">humans</a>&nbsp;interbreeding with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf\">elves</a>, blues often infiltrate goblin tribes to procreate with the females of the tribe, having a limited population of blue females to choose from. Many blues with strong psionic ability learn to control their physical form using psionics to assume the look of a normal goblin, thereby allowing easier integration into a goblin tribe. The blood of blues runs stronger than goblins, and therefore a tribe that knowingly or unknowingly allows blues to breed with them will over a matter of a few generations be composed completely of blues. Because of this, the blues were once hunted into near extinction by their goblin kin, prompting their stealthier and cautious ways. The blue elders will often breed and then leave a tribe, looking for a new place to spread their blood before it is destroyed.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description</strong>&nbsp;Short with leathery blue hide, large eyes and ears and a mouth filled with fangs, blues stand between 3 and 4 feet tall, with males slightly taller and heavier than females. Most blues have black hair on their heads, although some choose to go bald. To most, the blue is simply an oddly-colored goblin. Very few things make them stand out from their racial cousins, at least physically, aside from their skin tone.</p>\n<p><strong>Society</strong>&nbsp;Where goblins are disorganized, driven by their passions and need for activity, blues are quite the opposite. They are determined, focused, and driven to organization and structure. A tribe of goblins that doesn&rsquo;t kill a newborn blue will often come to be dominated by that blue, whose natural organizational skills and intelligence allows it to either rule the tribe outright, or manipulate the less intelligent goblins. These tribes tend to become focused and unified, whipped into structure not necessarily by the leadership qualities of the blue, but by his psionic power and intelligence. As a result, most of the dominant goblin societies are actually lead by a powerful blue; the few tribes of only blues that have popped up tend to welcome order and competition, finding common cause with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/ophiduan/\">ophiduans</a>&nbsp;.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations&nbsp;</strong>While driven and intelligent, most blues are colored by the dark ways of the tribes where they grew up. These blues tend to look down on all other races and wish to dominate and enslave them, which naturally makes them enemies to most races, but even a more mild-natured or civilized blue will be met by suspicion by half-giants,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf\">elves</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf\">dwarves</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome\">gnomes</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/dromites/\">dromites</a>, while the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/maenad/\">maenad</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/ophiduan/\">ophiduan</a>&nbsp;societies often find much in common with a blue&rsquo;s worldview, seeing the need for structure and order, which can equate to expansionistic and conquering tendencies..</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment and Religion</strong>&nbsp;Few blues are religious, believing themselves to be superior to the weak-willed people around them that need supernatural crutches to cope with a hostile world. Most blues tend to be lawful evil, tainted by their lives among the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-goblin\">goblin</a>&nbsp;tribes. Laws tend to protect the selfish more than the altruistic and therefore a blue would rather learn to use the rules than break them.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers</strong>&nbsp;Blues often become adventurers having been driven out by their home tribe, or they come from one of the few existing blue tribes. Even so, to wander means that they are either desperate (often for power) or cocky and unafraid. Blues find adventuring a means to an end, a way for them to become rich, powerful, and connected, with death one of the possible outcomes. To a blue, that is a fair bargain to be made.</p>\n<p><strong>Names</strong>&nbsp;Most blues outside of goblin society take a name from other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid\">humanoids</a>, which means that their naming conventions are as varied as that of all other races combined. However, many often add a descriptive title, such as &ldquo;Oman the Magnificent&rdquo; or &ldquo;Andra the Wild&rdquo; to enhance their individuality.</p>\n<div>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"><caption>Table: Random Starting Ages</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Adulthood</th>\n<th>Intuitive1</th>\n<th>Self-Taught2</th>\n<th>Trained3</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>12 years</td>\n<td>+1d4 years (13-16 years)</td>\n<td>+1d6 years (13-18 years)</td>\n<td>+2d6 years (14-24 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>1&nbsp;This category includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian\">barbarians</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle\">oracles</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue\">rogues</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerers</a>.<br />2&nbsp;This category includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard\">bards</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/cavalier\">cavaliers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighters</a>, gunslingers,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin\">paladins</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger\">rangers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner\">summoners</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch\">witches</a>.<br />3&nbsp;This category includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist\">alchemists</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">clerics</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druids</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor\">inquisitors</a>, magi,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monks</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizards</a>.</p>\n<div>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"><caption>Table: Random Height and Weight</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Gender</th>\n<th>Base Height</th>\n<th>Height Modifier</th>\n<th>Base Weight</th>\n<th>Weight Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Male</td>\n<td>3 ft. 10 in.</td>\n<td>+2d4 in.

This disposition can result in others viewing them as carefree or whimsical, but in truth, there is a deep philosophy behind their world view. To a xeph, the world is what you perceive, and their preference is to perceive it in a fun or humorous way, rather than as a morose place. Xephs are known for creating pieces of art of subtle beauty, and their racial homeland is said to be a great rift in the ground, where forests grow and the xephs thrive, using their ability to generate intense bursts of speed to travel the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Physical Description</strong>&nbsp;Standing about a hand shorter than a standard human, with males typically taller and heavier than females, xephs have deep olive or brown skin and pupil-less, amber-yellow eyes. While some find their lack of pupils unnerving, there is something about their attitude and world view that win over most people if given the opportunity. Most xephs prefer to fashion their dark black hair into a long braid. Xeph facial features have a tendency to be more angular and elongated than other humanoids, which along with their eyes, gives them a distinct look.</p>\n<p><strong>Society</strong>&nbsp;The xephs tend toward creating tightly-knit societies, often small in size and unassuming. When a xeph doesn&rsquo;t feel at home, they are encouraged to find their &lsquo;home of the heart&rsquo; in the wider world, or helped to integrate better with the village. Most xeph societies tend to be ruled by community consensus and on giving the xeph time to define their own life and world. Many find joy in the simplest of manual labors, often preferring to shy away from more advanced tools, loving what they see as a more in-touch experience. Craftsmen extraordinaire, the xephs enjoy creating, preferably with others, which means that their crafts are often sought by traders and merchants, providing the villages with sufficient resources that cannot be easily found or created by the xephs.</p>\n<p><strong>Relations</strong>&nbsp;Xephs tend to get along better with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/human\">humans</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/gnome\">gnomes</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/halfling\">halflings</a>, much because they tend to share a positive outlook on the world. They share a love of artwork and craftsmanship with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/elf\">elves</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/core-races/dwarf\">dwarves</a>, meaning they generally also get along with them.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/elan/\">Elans</a>&nbsp;unnerve most xephs, as if they can feel that something is wrong with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/elan/\">elans</a>, while they find the strange logic of the dromite and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/maenad/\">maenad</a>&nbsp;societies to be confusing. Half-orcs and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/races/half-giant/\">half-giants</a>&nbsp;tend to grate on xephs, with their war-like ways and brusque behavior.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment and Religion</strong>&nbsp;Tending more towards a unifying philosophy rather than a true religion, xephs believe that what one individual views as a god, another manifests in their life as a philosophy. As a result, xephs tend to be accepting of others&rsquo; religions, even if they do not themselves believe the same. Xephs tend to be good, with the race as a whole tending toward chaotic.</p>\n<p><strong>Adventurers</strong>&nbsp;Learning more about the world is a way to learn about the self to a xeph, and thus a journey is as much spiritual and internal as physical and external. Adventuring is exploring the mind, challenging morals, and defining who you are. Many don&rsquo;t catch onto this metaphysical and philosophical aspect of adventuring for xephs, and instead view them as jovial or humorous, even when faced with adversity.</p>\n<p><strong>Male Names&nbsp;</strong>Idrian, Earon, Ubiel, Ivraham, Yli, Ylijah, Alish, Ormak.</p>\n<p><strong>Female Names</strong>&nbsp;Uda, Udiva, Ymira, Hadyri, Chyrmona, Nyri, Nerith.</p>\n<div>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"><caption>Table: Random Starting Ages</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Adulthood</th>\n<th>Intuitive1</th>\n<th>Self-Taught2</th>\n<th>Trained3</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>18 years</td>\n<td>+1d4 years (19-22 years)</td>\n<td>+2d4 years (20-26 years)</td>\n<td>+2d6 years (20-30 years)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>1&nbsp;This category includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian\">barbarians</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle\">oracles</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue\">rogues</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/sorcerer\">sorcerers</a>.<br />2&nbsp;This category includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/bard\">bards</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/cavalier\">cavaliers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighters</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger/\">gunslingers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/paladin\">paladins</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/ranger\">rangers</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/summoner\">summoners</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch\">witches</a>.<br />3&nbsp;This category includes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/alchemist\">alchemists</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric\">clerics</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid\">druids</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/inquisitor\">inquisitors</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus/\">magi</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monks</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/wizard\">wizards</a>.</p>\n<div>\n<table border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\"><caption>Table: Random Height and Weight</caption>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Gender</th>\n<th>Base Height</th>\n<th>Height Modifier</th>\n<th>Base Weight</th>\n<th>Weight Modifier</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Male</td>\n<td>4 ft. 8 in.</td>\n<td>+2d10 in.

Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Bladeborn: Although most xephs are quick on their feet, some are lightning fast with their hands. A xeph with this racial trait gains the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/quick-draw/\">Quick Draw</a>&nbsp;and Weapon Proficiency (xephyr knife: 1d6 dmg; 18-20/x2 critical.) feats as bonus feats. This trait replaces the Burst trait.</li>\n<li>Call Blade: Xephs are perhaps the race that most commonly chooses the path of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/psionics-unleashed/classes/soulknife\">soulknife</a>. Some xephs have an innate tie to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Summoning\">summoning</a>&nbsp;a weapon from thin air. A xeph with this racial trait gains the ability to use call weaponry as a psi-like ability once per day with a manifester level equal to the xeph&rsquo;s character level. This trait replaces one daily use of the Burst trait and can be taken multiple times. Each time, it replaces one daily use of the Burst trait and increases the daily uses of the call weaponry psi-like ability by one.</li>\n<li>Explorer: Many xephs prefer to travel the world rather than to settle down. Xephs with this racial trait receive a +2 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(geography) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;checks. When manifesting psychoportation powers that only effect willing creatures or have a range of personal, xephs treat their manifester level as +1 higher than normal. This racial trait replaces one daily use of the Burst trait and the Innate Resistance racial traits.</li>\n<li>Quick Craftsman (Ex): Some xephs are swifter with their hands than their feet. A xeph with this trait reduces the time required for all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/item-creation-feats\">item creation</a>&nbsp;(whether via skill or feat) by half. This trait replaces two daily uses of the Burst trait.</li>\n<li>Troubadour: Most xephs are charismatic and natural entertainers. Xephs with this racial trait gain a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Racial-Bonus\">racial bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy\">Diplomacy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perform\">Perform</a>&nbsp;checks and, if they fail a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy\">Diplomacy</a>&nbsp;check to change a creature&rsquo;s attitude by less than 5, they can try to influence the creature a second time even if 24 hours have not passed. This trait replaces the Innate Resistance trait.</li>\n<li>Windweaver: Fleet of foot and nimble, some xephs are more adept at avoiding physical dangers rather than psionic ones. A xeph with this racial trait gains a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus\">dodge bonus</a>&nbsp;to his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">armor class</a>.
